Developed a full frontend on ReactJS with data loading from the server and page transitions.

Full stack:

- ReactJS

- Redux (data storage library for the client side)

- redux-thunk (additional library for Redux. Asynchronous actions).

- React Router (a library for implementing transitions without reloading the page).

- Axios (library for sending AJAX requests).

- json-server (for storing pizzas on a fake server)
